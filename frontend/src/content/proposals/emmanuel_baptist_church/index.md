### Proposal for website services

---

## WHY HAVE A WEBSITE?

---

#### Websites are your face to your online audience.

#### Websites

- Are vehicles for people to show what you do
- Give people knowledge for how to interact with your serivices
- Simple sites seamlessly give you your information.
- Complex sites take people time and can frustrate them into leaving.

---

#### It is in your best interest to have a site which

- shows your message 
- communicates what you offer
  - clearly
  - concisely
  - quickly. 

---

### Why for EBC?

#### A strong site:

- Would show what you are offing your community
- It will show people your values.
- Allow your members to support you and each other.
- Give you the ability to upload content on your blogs quickly.

---

#### It could:

- Show your value to your congregation by engaging them.
- Direct them important functions and events.
- Evangelize through imporant works you have done.
- Get your message out to your members.

---

## NEED

---

#### I have looked over your website

---

#### I have found (pros): 

- it is a very interactive website
- it is strongly designed full of bright colors
- displays current events readily on the home page

---

#### I have found (cons):

- Still it is hard to find meaningful information about services.
- Service times should be on the front page easily found.
- Your 4Gs motto/tennants are buried in the page and difficult to find.
- There are some pages that lead to empty information.
- It's very difficult to navigate on mobile.

---

#### I recommend: 

- a cleaner interface for website and especially mobile
- removal of dead links or pages that have no information
- A quicker one page interface that displays relevant service times and church projects.
- Analytics to see how many users donate, who is on the site and when and just to track which pages the members use.

---

## GOALS

---

#### I want your site to have a clean single page that displays all imporant information about services quickly.

---

#### It will

- direct the congregation to upcoming events and projects happening.
- display the churches motto/beliefs on the front page in a quick an concise manner.
- easily show the blog of the pastoral staff.

---

#### I recommend: 

- Removing dead links on the site.  And pages that have no information.
- Having an easier to understand calendar about upcoming events and services.
- A blog where pastors can upload their content themselves.  
- Adding google analytics to see which pages are used.

---

## STEPS

---

#### From what I've seen I see two possibilities where I can help the Emamanuel Baptist Church:

---

#### Option 1: I can clean up your existing wordpress site which involves:

- removing dead links
- This requires just managing the wordpress content and keeping it up to date.  
- Also cleaning up pastor's blog.
- Also adding google analytics to see how the congregation uses the site to see which pages are useful and which pages need help.    
  
  
  
#### With this option I can do work on the the current architecture but it will be more work (if even possible) to change interactions on the site.

---

#### Option 2: I can redo of the website.

- With this option, I will work with your designer redo the site in your image.
- I will still give you a panel to upload content via wordpress or netlify.
- I will help with any issues with user flow and organization of data.

---

## BUDGET

---

#### Comparison between option 1 and 2

- Option 1 will be quicker in the short term
- Option 2 will only cost more up front and will cost only a maitainance fee afterwards.
