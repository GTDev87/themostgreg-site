---

### I have looked over your website (pros)

- it is a very interactive website
- it is strongly designed full of bright colors
- displays current events readily on the home page

---

### I have looked over your website (cons):

- Still it is hard to find meaningful information about services.
- Service times should be on the front page easily found.
- Your 4Gs motto/tenants are buried in the page and difficult to find.
- There are some pages that lead to empty information.
- It's very difficult to navigate on mobile.

---

### I have looked over your website

I Recommend

- a cleaner interface for website and especially mobile
- removal of dead links or pages that have no information
- A quicker one page interface that displays relevant service times and church projects.
- Analytics to see how many users donate, who is on the site and when and just to track which pages the members use.

---

## GOALS

---

#### I want your site to have a clean single page that displays all important information about services quickly.

---

#### It will

- direct the congregation to upcoming events and projects happening.
- display the churches motto/beliefs on the front page in a quick an concise manner.
- easily show the blog of the pastoral staff.

---

#### I recommend: 

- Removing dead links on the site.  And pages that have no information.
- Having an easier to understand calendar about upcoming events and services.
- A blog where pastors can upload their content themselves.  
- Adding Google analytics to see which pages are used.

---

## STEPS

---

#### From what I've seen I see two possibilities where I can help the EBC.

---

#### Option 1: I can clean up your existing Wordpress site which involves:

- removing dead links
- This requires just managing the Wordpress content and keeping it up to date.  
- Also cleaning up pastor's blog.
- Also adding Google analytics to see how the congregation uses the site to see which pages are useful and which pages need help.    

---

#### Option 1: I can clean up your existing Wordpress site which involves:

With this option I can do work on the the current architecture but it will be more work (if even possible) to change interactions on the site.

---

#### Option 2: I can redo of the website.

- With this option, I will work with your designer redo the site in your image.
- I will still give you a panel to upload content via Wordpress or netlify.
- I will help with any issues with user flow and organization of data.

---

## BUDGET

---

#### Option 1 vs Option 2

- Option 1 will be quicker in the short term
- Option 2 will only cost more up front and will cost only a maintenance fee afterwards.
