## WHY?

### WHY HAVE A WEBSITE?

Websites are your face to your online audience, which nowadays is most of your audience.  They are not only vehicles for people to show what you do but also give people knowledge for how to interact with your serivices.  It is in your best interest to have a site which shows your message and communicates what you offer in a clear, concise and quick manner. 

### Why is this important the Emanuel Baptist Church?

A strong site:
- Would show what you are offing your community
- It will show people your values.
- Allow your members to support you and each other.
- Give you the ability to upload content on your blogs quickly.

It could:
- Show your value to your congregation by engaging them.
- Direct them important functions and events.
- Evangelize through imporant works you have done.
- Get your message out to your members.

## NEED

I have looked over your website, and I have found that while it is a very beautiful interactive website, it is hard to find meaningful information about services.  Service times should be on the front page easily found.  Your 4Gs motto/tennants are buried in the page and difficult to find.  Also, there are some pages that lead to empty information that could lead your memebers and people new to the site to leave.

I recommend: 
- a cleaner interface for website and especially mobile
- removal of dead links or pages that have no information
- A quicker one page interface that displays relevant service times and church projects.
- Analytics to see how many users donate, who is on the site and when and just to track which pages the members use.


## GOALS

I want your site to have a clean single page that displays all imporant information about services quickly.  It will direct the congregation to upcoming events and projects happening.  It will display the churches motto/beliefs on the front page in a quick an concise manner.  It will easily show the blog of the pastoral staff.

I recommend: 
- Removing dead links on the site.  And pages that have no information.
- Having an easier to understand calendar about upcoming events and services.
- A blog where pastors can upload their content themselves.  
- Adding google analytics to see which pages are used.

## STEPS

From what I've seen I see two possibilities where I can help the Emamanuel baptist church:

1. I can help by cleaning up the site by removing dead links and keeping data consistent across the site.  This requires just managing the wordpress site and keeping data up to date.  Also cleaning up pastor's blog.  Also adding google analytics to see how the congregation uses the site to see which pages are useful and which pages need help.  With this option I can do work on the the current architecture but it will be more work (if even possible) to change interactions on the site.

2. A full redo of the website.  This will give you and your designer the ability to redo the site in their image.  I am able to reconstruct the site from scratch.  I will still give you a panel to upload content via wordpress or netlify.   I will help with any issues with user flow and organization of data.

## BUDGET

While option 1 will be quicker in the short term, option 2 will only cost money up front and will cost only a maitainance fee afterwards and people in the congregation will easily be able to add events and blog posts to the site.  

## NEXT STEPS

Get back to me with a yes/no if you would like further information or if you would like to learn more about my thoughts on what can help your congregation succeed.
